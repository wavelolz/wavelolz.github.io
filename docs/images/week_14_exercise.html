	Definition: A topological order is a linear
ordering of the vertices of a graph such that,
for any two vertices i and j, if i is a
predecessor of j in the network, then i
precedes j in the linear ordering.Definition: Activity-On-Vertex network or AOV
network
– A directed graph G
– the vertices represent tasks or activities
– the edges represent precedence relations
between tasks. Definition: Vertex i in an AOV network G is a
predecessor of vertex j iff there is a directed
path from vertex i to vertex j.
– i is an immediate predecessor of j iff <i, j> is an
edge in G.
– If i is a predecessor of j, then j is an successor of i.
– If i is an immediate predecessor of j, then j is an
immediate successor of i.A path of the longest length is a critical path
 The earliest time that an event i can occur is
the length of the longest path from the start
vertex 0 to the vertex i
 The earliest time an event can occur
determines the earliest start time for all
activities (i.e., e(i)) represented by edges
leaving that vertex
For every activity ai, the latest time, l(i), that an activity may start without increasing the
project duration
