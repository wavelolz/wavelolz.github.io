		<br />On March 18, the student all over Taiwan gathered at and occupied the Exexutive Yuan
		<br />in Taipei for 24 days, in order to show the anger that Exexutive Yuan passed the 
		<br />"Agreement on Trade Services between the Taiwan Straits" with only 30 seconds.
		<br />During the protest, students showed great solidarity. This song, the Island Skylight
		<br />will encrave in every student who have joined the protest
